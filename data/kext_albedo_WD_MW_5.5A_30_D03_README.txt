   Extinction, Scattering, and Absorption Properties Computed for
   Carbonaceous - Silicate Model for Interstellar Dust with R_V=5.5

Model consists of mixture of carbonaceous grains and amorphous
silicate grains.  Carbonaceous grains are PAH-like when small, and
graphite-like when large (see Li & Draine 2001).  Size distributions
from Weingartner & Draine (2001, hereafter WD01) case "A" model for
R_V=5.5, renormalized following Draine (2003a) [see below].

PAH optical properties are from Li & Draine (2001).  The PAH/graphitic
grains in the log-normal size distributions are assumed to be 50%
neutral and 50% ionized.  The PAH/graphitic grains in the size
distribution given by eq. (5,6) of Weingartner & Draine (2001) are
assumed to be 100% ionized.

Graphite and silicate optical properties from Draine (2003b).

For R_V=3.1: grain abundances relative to H have been reduced by a
             factor 0.93 relative to the R_V=3.1 size distribution with
	     [C/H]_PAH=60ppm in WD01.
             Factor 0.93 is due to reduction in adopted value for
             A_Ic/N_H in local ISM.
	     PAH C abundance relative to H is assumed to be
             [C/H]_PAH = 0.93*60ppm = 55.8ppm

For R_V=4.0: grain abundances relative to H have been increased by a
             factor 0.93*1.27=1.18 relative to the R_V=4.0 size
             distribution with [C/H]_PAH=40ppm in WD01
             Factor 0.93 is due to reduction in adopted value for
             A_Ic/N_H in local ISM.
             Factor 1.27 is the increase in A_Ic/N_H for R_V=4.0
             relative to A_Ic/N_H for R_V=3.1, based on eq.(5) of
             Draine (2003a).
             PAH C abundance relative to H is assumed to be
             [C/H]_PAH = 0.93*1.27*40ppm = 47.2ppm

For R_V=5.5: THIS MODEL
             grain abundances relative to H have been increased by a
             factor 0.93*1.52=1.42 relative to the R_V=4.0 size
             distribution with [C/H]_PAH=30ppm in WD01.
             Factor 0.93 is due to reduction in adopted value for
             A_Ic/N_H in local ISM.
             Factor 1.52 is the increase in A_Ic/N_H for R_V=5.5
             relative to A_Ic/N_H for R_V=3.1, based on eq.(5) of
             Draine (2003a).
             PAH C abundance relative to H is assumed to be
	     [C/H]_PAH = 0.93*1.52*30ppm = 42.4ppm

Tabulated quantities:
lambda  = wavelength in vacuo (micron)
albedo  = (scattering cross section)/(extinction cross section)
<cos>   = <cos(theta)> for scattered light
C_ext/H = extinction cross section per H nucleon (cm^2/H)
K_abs   = absorption cross section per mass of dust (cm^2/gram)
<cos^2> = <cos^(theta)> for scattered light

2.199E-26 = M_dust per H nucleon (gram/H) for this dust model
